R&amp;D: Information system "Game championships". Expected technical and operational results: C ++ Qt project  Level 2 - "team", contains the name of the team, place occupied, the city where the team comes from, the name of the team captain. Level 3 - "participants", contains name, age, status (main / reserve).  This information is implemented in the form of a multi-list structure based on arrays of atypical pointers. In addition to the standard operations of entering data, correcting them, deleting and viewing them, saving the multi-list structure to a file and restoring from a file, the following specific operations must be performed:  Withdrawal of winners (3 first places) of each "What / where / when";  Display the average age of the players of each team  Search for tournaments in which the team participatedwith a graphical interface that provides work with information about game championships. The following are the levels that will be implemented in the project: The root "Game Championships" should contain the name of the game, the prize fund, the level of the game (city / regional / all-Ukrainian / world), the genre of the game. Level 1 - "what / where / when" tour number, place of the tour, time of the tour.

Level 1 - "what / where / when" tour number, place of the tour, time of the tour.
Level 2 - "team", contains the name of the team, place occupied, the city where the team comes from, the name of the team captain.
Level 3 - "participants", contains name, age, status (main / reserve).

This information is implemented in the form of a multi-list structure based on arrays of atypical pointers. In addition to the standard operations of entering data, correcting them, deleting and viewing them, saving the multi-list structure to a file and restoring from a file, the following specific operations must be performed:
Withdrawal of winners (3 first places) of each "What / where / when";
Print the average age of the players of each team
